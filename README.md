# FarGate App

FarGate is an app that allows you to govern your house's smart functionalities when you are away.
It exploits a telegram channel between two bots, in which a bot sends a specific message (bot command) based on user interaction with the app, and the other bot reads the message and executes the command in it.

The app has been developed through Expo, an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
