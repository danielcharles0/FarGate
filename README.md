# FarGate App

FarGate is an app that allows you to govern your house smart functionalities when you are away from it.
It exploits a telegram channel between two bots, in which a bot sends a specific message (bot command) based on user interaction with the app, and the other bot reads the message and executes the command in it.

The app has been developed on Expo Snack, an online platform for developing and sharing Expo projects.
